## How to make it work locally on your system?

- First of all, ensure that XAMMP is up and running on your machine.
- Next, pull this repository into an empty local repository on your machine. The name of the folder must be _My_Introduction_ and it should be present inside _htdocs_ folder of XAMMP.
- Start the Apache Service from XAMMP control panel.
- That's it! Now access the project locally by entering this into any browser's url: localhost/My_Introduction
